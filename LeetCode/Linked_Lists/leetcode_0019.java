// LeetCode 19: Remove Nth Node From End of List
// Approach: First, count the total nodes; then traverse to the (count-n)th node and skip the next node; handle edge case when head needs to be removed
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
// Learning: Two-pass approach is simple; careful handling of edge cases like removing the head is important

// Solution
