// LeetCode 226: Invert Binary Tree
// Approach: Use recursion (postorder traversal); recursively invert the left and right subtrees first, then swap the left and right child pointers of the current node, and return the root
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(h)
// Learning: Tree inversion can be done by recursively processing subtrees and modifying pointers in place, reinforcing the bottom-up nature of postorder traversal

// Solution
