// LeetCode 145: Binary Tree Postorder Traversal
// Approach: Use recursive DFS where we first traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally process the root, storing node values in a list
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n)
// Learning: Postorder traversal follows Left-Right-Root order and is useful for problems that require processing children before their parent, such as tree deletion or bottom-up calculations

// Solution
