// LeetCode 104: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
// Approach: Use recursive DFS; for each node, compute the depth of its left and right subtrees and return 1 plus the maximum of those two depths
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(h)
// Learning: Tree depth problems follow the classic recursive pattern of solving left and right subtrees and combining results using 1 + max(left, right), reinforcing divide-and-conquer thinking

// Solution
