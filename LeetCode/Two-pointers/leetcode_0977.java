// LeetCode 977: Squares of a Sorted Array
// Approach: Use two pointers at the beginning and end of the sorted array; compare squared values and place the larger square at the end of the result array, moving pointers inward
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n)
// Learning: In a sorted array, opposite-end two pointers combined with filling from the back avoid unnecessary sorting
