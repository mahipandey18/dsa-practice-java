// Solution
// LeetCode 344: Reverse String
// Approach: Use two pointers starting from the beginning and end of the character array; swap characters at both pointers and move them inward until they meet
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
// Learning: Two-pointer technique is ideal for in-place array manipulation and avoids using extra space
