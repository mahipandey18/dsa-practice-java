# DSA Practice in Java
Structured practice of Data Structures and Algorithms in Java with clear explanations and complexity analysis

This repository contains my structured practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. The goal of this repository is to strengthen core problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding fundamentals required for software engineering internships and further computer science studies.
I focus on understanding the logic behind each problem rather than memorizing solutions. For each problem, I include comments explaining the approach, time complexity, and key learnings.

## Language Used
- Java

## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Recursion
- Linked List (to be added)
- Trees (to be added)

## Structure
Each folder represents a specific DSA topic.  
Each problem is solved in a separate Java file with explanatory comments.
